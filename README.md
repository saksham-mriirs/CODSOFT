# CODSOFT
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
During my internship, I developed multiple Python-based mini-projects that helped me build practical programming skills, improve logical thinking, and gain confidence in problem-solving. The key projects I worked on include a chatbot, a movie recommendation system, and a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

1. Chatbot (Rule-Based Conversation System)
I created a simple rule-based chatbot using Python that can interact with users by responding to predefined inputs. Through this project, I learned:

How to design interactive conversational flows.

The basics of natural language processing logic.

Conditional statements and input/output handling.

The importance of user-friendly interfaces, even in a text-based environment.

2. Movie Recommendation System
This project focused on recommending movies based on the user's interests. It involved:

Taking user input and matching it with a curated list of genres or titles.

Creating suggestion logic using lists, dictionaries, and if-else conditions.

Providing recommendations dynamically, which strengthened my understanding of how recommendation systems work at a basic level.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python Console Game)
I built a console-based version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. In this project, I developed:

A turn-based game loop with user input.

Logic for checking win and draw conditions.

A deeper understanding of arrays (lists) and condition-based loops.

Good practices for game flow control and UI structure within the console.
